#### At the exam date

<!--text-box variant="hint" name="Huomio">
<notice>Exams sivulla on teknisiä ongelmia</notice>

Tässä ohje miten sivun saa toimimaan.

 Jos et pääse kirjautumaan examsiin, sivut näyttävät oudolle tai painikkeet sivulla eivät toimi:
 * Kokeile ensin päivittää (ladata uudelleen) sivu monta kertaa. Jos sivun päivittäminen ei auta, kokeile sivun avaamista toisella selaimella. Firefox ja Edge on todettu parhaiten toimiviksi. Chromella sivusto toimii huonoiten.
 * Jos sivu ei toimi toisellakaan selaimella, kokeile vielä silläkin päivittää sivua useamman kerran.

</text-box-->
